This is my first website (in PHP) which was part of my Databases-Driven Application Development module in my second year. This is a delivery box subscription service using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website mainly focuses on functionality more than the front end. The product allows users to search for items and recipes, add items to the basket, and register/log in before proceeding to checkout.
